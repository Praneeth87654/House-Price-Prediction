# House-Price-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting house prices using a deep learning model built with PyTorch. It utilizes embeddings and batch normalization techniques to enhance model performance, achieving a low Root Mean Absolute Error (RMAE). The model is trained on structured data to learn meaningful patterns for accurate predictions.
